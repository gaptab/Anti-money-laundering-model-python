AML Model Development:

Develop and validate an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) model using feedback-based reinforcement learning.

Clustering Models:

Compare and evaluate the performance of CLARA (Clustering Large Applications) and KMeans.

Improve clustering using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Graph Theory Analysis:

Analyze criminal networks using graph theory, replicating the airline hub-and-spoke model.

Step 1: Dummy Data for AML Models
Simulated a transaction dataset with features like Amount, Country_Risk, Customer_Risk, and Transaction_Type.
Standardized the data for clustering.

Step 2: Clustering Models (KMeans vs. CLARA)
Applied KMeans and CLARA clustering algorithms.
Compared their performance using the silhouette score.
Enhanced the clustering process using PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualized the results.

Step 3: Graph Theory for Criminal Networks
Created a graph to simulate a criminal network with nodes (criminals) and weighted edges (relationships).
Visualized the graph and calculated centrality metrics to identify key players.
Simulated an airline hub-and-spoke model by finding shortest paths.

Step 4: Feedback-Based Reinforcement Learning
Designed a simple model that adjusts its decision threshold based on feedback.
Demonstrated iterative updates to improve predictions.

Outputs

Clustering Results: Silhouette scores to compare KMeans and CLARA. PCA-enhanced clustering visualization.

Graph Analysis: Visual graph representation. Centrality metrics and shortest paths.

Reinforcement Learning: Iterative updates to model thresholds based on feedback.
